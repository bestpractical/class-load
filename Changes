- All this module's subroutines now accept optional parameters for a module so
  you can write something like - load_class( 'Foo', { -version => 42 } )

- There is now a Class::Load::XS distro available on CPAN which implements
  some of this module's code in XS for speed. This code was originally written
  by Goro Fuji and Florian Ragwitz for Class::MOP. You need to install this
  distro explicitly if you want the XS implementation.

- Added a load_first_existing_class subroutine based, mostly borrowed from
  Class::MOP.

- Fixed a bug where a package with a version object in its $VERSION would not
  be seen as loaded. Reported by Chris Prather.

- BACK COMPAT CHANGE: Remove $Class::Load::ERROR in favor of a contextual
  return value. ( Jesse Luehrs )

- Add load_optional_class($class) that fails only if there is a problem with
  the attempted-to-load $class. ( Kent Fredric )

- Force internal require to try-again if we are SURE the class is not
  there. This produces reliable errors. ( Kent Fredric )

- Replace Test::Exception with Test::Fatal ( Kent Fredric )
