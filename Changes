Revision history for Class-Load

0.07
        Strip the "at /foo/Class/Load.pm line bar." from the error returned
        by try_load_class(), and make load_class() and load_optional_class()
        chomp it before croaking it back to the user. This means that
        load_class() now returns the same error as require() would.

        BACK COMPAT CHANGE: Remove $Class::Load::ERROR in favor of a
        contextual return value ( Jesse Luehrs )

        Add load_optional_class($class) that fails only if
        there is a problem with the attempted-to-load $class.
        ( Kent Fredric )

        Force internal require to try-again if we are SURE the class
        is not there. This produces reliable errors. ( Kent Fredric )

        Replace Test::Exception with Test::Fatal ( Kent Fredric )
